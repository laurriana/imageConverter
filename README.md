# webp converter and icon changer

## description
hello! today I found myself downloading files for an editing project like I always do and an idea struck. to understand in full, i often find myself accidentally saving webP files (which aren’t accepted by after effects) and so I have to convert them later using a web converter. over the break, I found myself rotting bed more than coding, which obviously isn’t good. so, I decided to code this app.

one thing I’ve always wanted to try with python was user interface. I knew it was possible because I used to code visual novels with python and ren'py, but I didn’t know how to go about it. that’s when I asked my copilot and at first I didn’t understand his response but I decided to give it a shot regardless by searching the terms he gave me. and that’s how I found myself using tkinter for the app.

### what I learned
* how to design an app using tkinter
* themes and colors with customtkinter
* manipulating window dimensions

it’s also worth mentioning I added a lot of features but because I was too reliant on copilot since this was a new territory I didn’t plan on exploring, I decided to remove them so this project could be entirely me.

## features

1. **webp to png conversion**
2. **png to ico conversion**
3. **change app icon**

## how to use

1. **install dependencies:**
   
   ```
   pip install Pillow
   ```
3. **run the app**
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
### requirements
* Python 3.x
* Pillow library for image processing
